For experimenter:
1.	Make sure the computer’s volume is set to 50%
2.	Wipe clean the headphone before each participant
3.	Make sure they wear the headphone throughout the experiment
4.	Open Psychopy – Go to File -> Preference 
a.	Make sure the audio library is set to [‘pygame’]
5.	Load the experiment scripts and run them sequentially
a.	stroop_practice.py   - Feel free to repeat this part if the participant isn’t getting the task
b.	stroop.py [9 min for repetition=2, 18 min for repetition =4]
c.	filler.py [8 min]
d.	memory.py [12 min]
e.	sourceMem.py [8 min]
Task 1 – Show them the separate sheet of instruction.

Task 2 – 
(The instructions are pretty clear on the screen except that it’s a lot of words to read. So read through that with them. It’s a task-switching experiment, but they will first go through 2 “single-task” blocks to practice their assigned SR mapping. 
So right before they start the task, emphasize to them their first task (Color of the task and SR mapping:  ask them to memorize those). 
The second task and its SR mapping will be shown again at the beginning of the next block. 
The third block includes both tasks (task-switching). But there will be no more instruction about task colors and their SR mapping.

Task 3 – 
This is a memory recognition task + (occasional) tone detection task.  
They will use left middle and index finger for “v” and “b”, and use their right index and middle figure for “n” and “m.”
These four keys are used for the memory recognition task (2 sec per trial). 
Occaionally, they’ll get a probe question asking whether they have heard a faint tone or not. 
For the probe question, it will wait until they make a response(press Y or N, indicated on the screen) and then proceed.

Task 4 – 
This is the last task. Another memory judgement task. They will be asked to recall whether the image appeared in an easy or a hard block using “E” for easy blocks and “H” for hard blocks.
