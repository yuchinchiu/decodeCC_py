In this following experiment, you will perform a couple of tasks and the experimenter will guide you through each task.  
You will wear the headphone during the entire experiment (as you might hear some words or sounds).
The headphone has been sanitized with alcohol pads.

Task 1 –
The first task is an image categorization task. Your task is judge whether the object in the image presented on the screen is an image of a ‘natural’ object (e.g., a cow) or a ‘man-made’ object (e.g., a shovel). 
Please place your left index finger on the ‘G’ and place your right index figure on ‘J.’ 
These 2 keys are to be used for indicating your categorization responses. 
You will first do some practice trials and then perform the main task.
You will also hear some words through the headphone. However, the word might be ‘natural’ or ‘man-made’ and they might or might not correspond to the categorization response you are trying to make. Remember:  your task is to categorize the image. 
There will be two kinds of blocks – “Easy” vs. “Hard.”
For “easy” blocks: the word spoken through the headphone almost always matches the category of the object, which helps your categorization performance.
For “hard” blocks: the word spoken through the headphone almost never matches the category of the object, which hinders your categorization performance.
To prepare you, “easy” vs. “hard” instruction will appear at the beginning of every 10 trials.
You should make use of these instructions to get yourself ready for the following type of trials.
